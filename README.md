# Algo-Visualizer
This is where I am putting all the algorithm visualizers I am building. I will updating this as I create more....for now this includes a binary search visualizer üçª

How the Binary Search UI works:

* Input the array in the inputArray field and click Enter. The array can be unsorted, it will sort the array for you and display sorted array for you.
